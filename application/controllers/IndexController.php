 * Class IndexController

 * The Main Project starts here
 *
 * For everyone editing this, please check the rules:
 *
 * - Do not code PSR, it sucks
 * - Brackets are on the same line of the method
 * - If you don't sacrifice readability for brevity, you are a pussy
 * - Real code has real small methods reusing functions as much as possible
 * - This means that low level code must be on the core, not on your method
